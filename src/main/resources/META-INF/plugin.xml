        <!--
          See https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/basic-action-system.html#registering-actions
          for information about the elements and attributes used for actions and groups.

          This <action> element adds a static menu item in first position of the Tools menu that shows PopupDialogAction.
          Note this element has no text or description attributes because translations for them are given
          by action-id in the resource-bundle.
          An <override-text> element is also used for demonstration purposes to show alternate text and description strings
          for this action's entries in the MainMenu. (Which includes the ToolsMenu. Try commenting out the override-text
          element and see how the menu text changes.) The alternate text and description attributes do not
          appear here because they are defined by action-id in the resource-bundle.
